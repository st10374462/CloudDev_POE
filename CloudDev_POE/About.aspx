            The story of our platform's inception is one of passion and dedication.
                <br />

            It all began when our founder, deeply motivated by his vision<br />
            realising the lack of opportunities that talented individuals had to reach a wider audience.
                <br />
            Determined to make a difference, our founder embarked on a journey to create a platform<br />
            that would bridge the gap between artisans and consumers, thus giving birth to our e-commerce platform.
